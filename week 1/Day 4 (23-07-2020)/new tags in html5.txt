HTML5 offers new semantic elements to define different parts of a web page:

<article>  
A self-contained composition in a document that is independently distributable or reusable, e.g. a forum post, a magazine or newspaper article, or blog entry.
Represents an independent piece of content of a document, such as a blog entry or newspaper article.

<aside>  
Defines content tangentially related to the content surrounding it, such as related reading links and glossaries, which may or not be nested within an article element.
Represents a piece of content that is only slightly related to the rest of the page.

<section>  
Unlike the <div> tag, which is used for a myriad of purposes, not the least of which is formatting content, the <section> element demarcates a thematic grouping of content. 
Each section typically includes a heading element and associated content within DIVs and Paragraphs. Examples include introduction, blog entries, and contact information.
Represents a generic document or application section.

<nav>  
Denotes a section with navigation links, either to other pages or to parts within the same page.
Represents a section of the document intended for navigation.

<header>  
Not be confused with the <head> element, the <header> tag typically contains the section?s heading (an h1?h6 element), as well as other content, such as a navigation links, 
table of contents, a search form, or any relevant logos.
Represents a group of introductory or navigational aids.

<footer>  
For content located at the very bottom of the web page or nearest section. A footer typically contains information about its section such as who wrote it, 
links to related documents, copyright data, etc. It in turn may contain entire sections, with appendices, indexes, license agreements, and other similar content.
Represents a footer for a section and can contain information about the author, copyright information, et cetera.
